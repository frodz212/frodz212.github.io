# Felipe Rodriguez Portfolio

## About

My name is Felipe Rodriguez. This repo contains details and information of the projects completed during my masters program at Bellevue University. I have 3 years of experience in data analytics and validation. I am currently employed at Allstate as a Quality Analyst Senior Consultant. 

The masters program and my current job have allowed me to apply all the knowledge gained and apply various analyical techniques to solve data issues. As I have progressed in the program, I have found an interest in predictive modeling and want to persue a career as a Data Scientist.
